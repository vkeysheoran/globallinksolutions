          Understanding the demand/requirement of our clients is the first and the most important step in our process. We liaise with not
          only the client, however, with our potential candidates as well to understand the needs, match them and align in the same direction.

        <p class="pxp-text-light text-justify">
          Nesting comes into picture right after the final selection is done of a potential candidate. Nesting brings in various areas and
          questions a resource might have before they begin their journey. This is where we come into picture and align them with the place
          of stay & work.
